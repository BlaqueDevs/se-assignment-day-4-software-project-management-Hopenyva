## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Time delivery impacts client's satisfaction, project cost and team morale.
To ensure deadlines are met project managers should set clear defined goals and break down the project into smaller tasks with clear deadlines.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns? 
Effective cost control ensures that resources are used efficiently to prevent extra costs on budget that can impact the overall project .
Detailed budget planning , agile budgeting for flexibility and resource allocation can be used to prevent budget overrun.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is a flexible methodology that allows the project to be completed in sprints.
Advantages of Agile
Agile is flexible and allows change in project scope.
Agile ensures client satisfaction by engaging them throughout the project.
Agile allows risks to be addressed earlier hence prevents major issues that can arise later.

Disadvantages of Agile
It's flexibility can lead to uncontrolled changes.
Requires high client involvement which is challenging.

Delayed feedback as testing is done at the end of the project.
Limited involvement of the client.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial in projects that are complex and require high client involvement.
example is E-commerce websites and mobile app development.
Waterfall is beneficial in projects that have well defined objectives and are less likely to change.
Example is Banking systems and Government projects.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Establishing well defined goals.
Using suitable methodologies.
Maintaining comprehensive documentation.
Implementation of continuous testing.

Importance of maintaining high standards 
To ensure cost efficiency.
To make sure the client is satsified .
To create a good reputation.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
It ensures effective resource allocation.
Enhances client satisfaction.
Sets expectations of the end of the project.
Facilitates risk management.

WBS is the breakdown of the total scope of the project hierarchically.
It is useful in;
Facilitating resource allocation.
Improving task management.
Promoting accountability.
Enables better cost allocation.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
It ensures effective project tracking.
Ensures effective accountability.
Enables identification of potential risks.

How Gantt charts assist
Gantt charts make it easy to adjust timelines.
They are easy for stakeholders to understand and enhances communication with non- technical  audiences.
Help manage workloads by showing who is assigned to which task.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address the difficulties associated with house hunting in Kenyan cities for students and low income individuals.
Students and low income individuals have a hard time looking for affordable housing in better neighborhoods , therefore my software will address this issue by connecting the tenants to landlords directly despite the distance.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
By clearly defining the problem I will be able to create a more targeted and cost effective design, prevent scope creep and come up with accurate requirements gathering.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I would focus on how it addresses the core problem, its benefit to users and how it enhances overall outcomes. For example 
My software is a user-friendly platform designed to connect house hunting clients to landlords directly . It offers a secure way for clients to find affordable rental houses in secure environments. My app empowers users to make informed decisions on their housing.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Booking and scheduling system.
Rental history and reviews.
Advanced search and filters.
User friendly interface.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software.
Kenyan cities are experiencing rapid population growth who are in need of housing due to urbanization.Most universities with a high population are in major Kenyam cities and cannot accommodate most Kenyan students. 70 % of my target audience use the internet and hence possibility of relying on an app for house hunting is high.Moreover, people are in need of more affordable direct rental solutions. Therefore,my app will always have clients seeking our services.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It is crucial in positioning and developing my software as it provides insight into competitive landscapes and technological advancements.
